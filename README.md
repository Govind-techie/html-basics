# 🌐 HTML Basics

Welcome to a beginner-friendly repository designed to help you master the fundamentals of **HTML**. Here, you'll find clear explanations, practical examples, and best practices covering essential HTML concepts, tags, and structure.

This project marks the start of my **full-stack web development journey**. My goal is to build a solid foundation by learning and practicing core HTML skills, and to share my progress along the way.

I’ll be updating this repository regularly with new topics, examples, and improvements as I continue learning.
