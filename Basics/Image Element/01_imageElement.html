<!-- 
    <img> Element in HTML

    Purpose:
    - Used to embed images in a web page.

    Key Attributes:
    1. src (source):
        - Specifies the path (URL or local file) to the image.
        - Example: src="images/photo.jpg" or src="https://example.com/photo.jpg"

    2. alt (alternative text):
        - Provides descriptive text if the image cannot be displayed.
        - Improves accessibility for screen readers.
        - Helps SEO by describing the image content.

    3. width and height (optional):
        - Set the display size of the image (in pixels).
        - Example: width="200" height="100"

    Best Practices:
    - Always include the alt attribute for accessibility.
    - Prefer relative paths for local images to avoid broken links.
    - Use descriptive alt text relevant to the image content.

    Example:
    <img src="images/logo.png" alt="Company Logo" width="150" height="50">

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <title>Image Tag</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <!-- <img> tag is used to display images in HTML -->

        <!-- 
            'src' (source) attribute contains the image URL or file path
            You can use:
              - Absolute URL (like the one below) to load image from the internet
              - Relative URL to load an image from your local project folder
              
            NOTE: Using absolute URLs is quick, but risky if the external image is deleted or changed it can also crash on your webpage.
            Best practice is to store and use local (relative) image files when possible.

            - Helps with accessibility and SEO

        <img src="https://wallpapercave.com/wp/wp1937346.png" alt="Image"> <!--Absolute Link image-->
        <!-- Note: The link used in this example is an absolute URL (from the internet) -->

        <!-- Note: To use a relative link, you need to download the image and place it in the same folder as your project -->
