    Relative Link with href:
    - A relative link uses a path relative to the current page's location.
    - The 'href' attribute specifies the path to another file within the same website or project.
    - Clicking the link will navigate to another page or resource in the same site.
    - Example: <a href="about.html">About Us</a>
    - Relative links are useful for linking internal pages or resources.
