  - <div> is a block-level element.
  - Used to group other HTML elements together.
  - Helps organize content and apply styles or layouts.
  - Does not add any visual change by itself.
  - Commonly used as a container for sections, layouts, or wrappers.
  - Can contain both block and inline elements.


  Note: Div is a container used to hold other HTML elements or group elements together.

            Think of it as a container that allows you to group and apply styles or changes to a specific section of code 
            without affecting the entire document. -->
