<!-- 
  HTML Entities:

  - HTML entities are special codes used to display reserved characters in HTML.
  - They start with & and end with ; (e.g., &lt; for <, &gt; for >).
  - Useful for displaying symbols, accented characters, and invisible characters.
  - Common examples:
      &lt;   displays <
      &gt;   displays >
      &amp;  displays &
      &quot; displays "
      &apos; displays '
  - Prevents conflicts with HTML syntax and ensures correct rendering.

  Note:
    • An HTML entity is a piece of text ("string") that begins with an ampersand (&) and ends with a semicolon (;).
    • used to display reserved characters (which would otherwise be interpreted as HTML code), and invisible characters (like non-breaking spaces).
    • can also use in place of characters that are difficult to type with a standard keyboard.
    • browser interprets them & renders correct character

    <h1>Common HTML Entities</h1>

    <!-- The ampersand (&) is a reserved character, so we use &amp; -->
    <p>This is how you write an ampersand: <b>&amp;</b></p>

    <!-- Less-than and greater-than signs must be escaped or they might break the HTML -->
    <p>To show HTML tags in text: <b>&lt;p&gt;Hello&lt;/p&gt;</b></p>

    <!-- Quotes inside attributes can be written using entities -->
    <p>Double Quote: <b>&quot;Hello&quot;</b></p>
    <p>Single Quote: <b>&apos;Hello&apos;</b></p>
